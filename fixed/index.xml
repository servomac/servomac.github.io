      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Toni Piz√†. I&amp;rsquo;m a developer with a wide range of interests, mainly involved in algorithmics, distributed systems and machine learning. I have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science by the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), and I have coursed a master degree in Computing by the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). Unfortunately, due to a variety of personal problems, I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished my master thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked as a backend developer and devops engineer. Currently i&amp;rsquo;m starting a new path in the data science field, with special emphasis in machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is an attempt to improve my written expression in english. Also, putting down my ideas is a good way to structurate them, and the public exposure can be useful to recolect feedback of people with more experience than me. I will appreciate any comment, correction and improvement to the opinions exposed in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
