<p>This blog is an attempt to improve my written expression in english. Also, putting down my ideas is a good way to structurate them, and the public exposure can be useful to recolect feedback of people with more experience than me. I will appreciate any comment, correction and improvement to the ideas exposed in this blog.</p>
