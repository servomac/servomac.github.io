      <title>Learning from imbalanced data</title>

      <description>What is an imbalanced dataset? Most algorithms for machine learning assume that the training set data classes are balanced. But a lot of real world scenarios present classification problems where the involved classes aren&amp;rsquo;t equally represented: one class is composed by a large number of instances, while the other contains a small number of examples. In this case, the learning algorithm may have difficulties learning the concepts representing the minority class.</description>

Currently I&amp;rsquo;m working as a devops engineer, but I&amp;rsquo;m pivoting to a data science / machine learning developer position. I have always been interested in a wide range of aspects of the computer science, being more a generalist than a specialist (even that market seems to favour specialists in a concrete level of the stack, and I have specialized in distributed systems and web reliability).</description>
